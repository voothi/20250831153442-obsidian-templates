# RFC: v1.1.0 Release - Vault Functionalization & ZID Re-anchoring

**Staging for v1.1.0**
**Reference**: my request 20260104140151

## Overview
This release focuses on transforming the `vault/` directory into a fully functional, documented Obsidian example vault, consolidating all technical manuals, and re-anchoring the entire knowledge graph to a modern ZID baseline.

## Impacted Requests (ZIDs)
- 20260103194515: Initial vault restructuring.
- 20260104102921: Master script relocation.
- 20260104105345: Documentation consolidation into `docs/`.
- 20260104105850: Table of Contents audit and alignment.
- 20260104110416: Plugin link verification.
- 20260104111810: Implementation of active Markdown links in docs.
- 20260104115823: Enrichment of Case 1 with real vault examples.
- 20260104122151: Global ZID re-indexing across vault and documentation.
- 20260104132211: Final link integrity audit and redundancy cleanup.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Structural Analytics: Separation of Responsibilities
We transitioned from a mixed-root structure to a "Clean Hub" model:
- `vault/templates/`: Pure configuration and master scripts (`_new.md`, `_moc.md`, `_update.md`).
- `vault/voothi/`: Atomic content notes and Map of Content (MOC) indexers.
- `docs/`: Centralized technical manuals, decoupled from the templates folder to ensure clean deployment.

### 2. Decision: Global ZID Re-anchoring
**Observation**: The previous example notes used fragmented or legacy ZIDs (e.g., 2022, 2025 mixed).
**Decision**: Standardize all example notes and documentation references to a single chronological anchor starting at `20260104122151`.
**Reasoning**: This provides a cohesive "starting point" for new users, making the chronological relationship between examples (Work, Goals, Daily Plans) intuitive and internally consistent.

### 3. Decisions on Polymorphism & Graph Integrity
- **Polymorphism**: The `Goal for 2025.` note was explicitly configured to demonstrate many-to-many relationships (Work, Finances, Languages).
- **Survival Logic**: Documentation was enriched to explain how the `_moc.md` engine handles partial deletions, ensuring users understand the "MOC as Master" logic.
- **Link Hybridization**: Added dual links (GitHub-friendly Markdown + Obsidian-friendly Wikilinks) to ensure the documentation is fully interactive in both web environments and live vaults.

### 4. Cleanup & Safety
- Removed redundant legacy files (`20220201130701-work.md`, etc.).
- Automated verification using python scripts to ensure zero "dead links" remained after re-indexing.

## Conclusion
v1.1.0 establishes a robust, interactive, and logically consistent foundation for the project, successfully bridging the gap between technical scripts and user-facing documentation.
