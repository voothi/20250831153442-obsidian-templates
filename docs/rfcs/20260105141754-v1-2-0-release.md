## Implementation Details
### Analytics & Decisions

#### 1. Logic Unification
The core decision for this release was to unify the logic between the Python utility scripts (`obsidian_zid_wikilink.py`) and the internal Obsidian template (`_new.md`). Previously, there were discrepancies in how ZIDs were detected and how filenames were sanitized.

- **Decision**: Adopt the Python script's regex and sanitization rules as the single source of truth.
- **Result**: The `_new.md` template now uses the exact same `zidLineRegex` and `replacements` map as the external tools, ensuring that files created via Ahk hotkeys match those created via Obsidian templates.

#### 2. Heading Support
A specific gap was identified where `Process Batch` (Mode 3) would fail to detect ZIDs if they were formatted as Markdown headings (e.g., `## 20260105...`).

- **Decision**: Update `zidLineRegex` to include `#{1,6}\s+` as a valid prefix.
- **Impact**: Users can now outline their day using headings and instantly convert that outline into ZID-based notes without manually stripping the hashes.

#### 3. Sanitization Refinement
The `sanitizeName` function was updated to handle German Eszett (`ß` and `ẞ`) consistently and to treat periods followed by spaces (`. `) as separators, which improves the readability of generated filenames from sentences.
