# Release Notes

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul**:
  - New root `README.md` with Table of Contents and project overview.
  - Detailed `templater/README.md` covering `_new.md`, `_update.md`, and `_moc.md`.
  - Detailed `daily-note-calendar/README.md` covering the `day-planner.md` template and plugin setup.
- **Visual Guides**: Integration of asset screenshots as step-by-step visual documentation.
- **Kardenwort Ecosystem**: Added context for the broader learning environment.

### Changed
- **Relative Navigation**: All internal links are now relative for better portability.
- **Plugin Instructions**: Enriched with specific folder paths and hotkey recommendations (`Alt + Q`, `Alt + A`, `Alt + S`).
- **Internal Anchors**: Standardized "Return to Top" links to point to same-file Table of Contents.

### Fixed
- **Plugin Attribution**: Corrected documentation to reflect that Daily Note Calendar (not Periodic Notes) handles the temporal note structure in this setup.
